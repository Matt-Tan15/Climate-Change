                <h2>Summary</h2>
               <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.
                Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.

Apart from affecting the coastal fishing and fisheries, exposure to oil spills have negative health effects on marine life. The negative effects on marine life relate to the accumulation of persistent and bioaccumulative components of oil in the tissue and bodies of marine life (fish) with the potential to induce a variety of health and reproductive problems, as well as mass mortality events within marine life in general.</div>

When there are oil spills in the ocean or freshwater, it does not blend with the water. Oil floats on the surface of salt and fresh water. Over a very short period of time, the oil spreads out into a very thin layer across the surface of the water. This can block sunlight from reaching oceanic environments, which can severely impact producers and, thus, the entire food chain of an ecosystem.</div>

                    Agriculture—including how we grow, raise, transport, process, and even store food and nonfood crops and agriculture products—has a profound effect on the planet. For example, the almost 9.5 billion animals raised for food each year in the United States. Or what goes into growing this country’s more than 90 million acres of corn, used mainly for livestock feed and ethanol production. The monumental quantities of fertilizers and pesticides that go into those operations are just a few examples of the pollution associated with agriculture.
                    Agricultural pollution is the contamination we release into the environment as a by-product of growing and raising livestock, food crops, animal feed, and biofuel crops.<br>
                    <br>Agricultural pollution has many different sources. Nitrogen-based fertilizers produce potent greenhouse gases and can overload waterways with dangerous pollutants; chemical pesticides with varying toxicological effects can contaminate our air and water or reside directly on our food. Sometimes we can clearly see (or even smell) the pollution and its source, like manure from a farm. Other times, the pollutant may be more indirect, like methane—another significant contributor to global warming—released through the digestive systems of cows. Agricultural pollution is generally divided into two categories: pollution that comes from raising animals, and pollution from growing crops including animal feed, human food, and biofuel crops.</p>
