          <p>To those of you that are not aware of the risks that come with ozone depletion, I'll tell you how bad it is. 
          Picture your loved ones, now how would you feel if they have cancer? That sucks doesn't it? So listen up to what I'm about to tell you,
          our ozone layer is what protects us from the harmful rays of the Sun, which is harmful for our health and increases the risk of skin cancers, 
          and us humans are destroying it.
          </p>
          <p>You might be wondering about how we are destroying our ozone layer, one prime example would be air pollution. The hole in our ozone layer is 
          caused by man-made air pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons and halons, and many more. It is because of us that we're putting everyone 
          on Earth at risk.</p>
          <p>If you're wondering about how to prevent the ozone layer from being damaged any further, start raising awareness and spread the word about it.
          Our ozone layer may regenerate if we can prevent doing any more harm to it.</p>
