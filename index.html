            <h1>Synopsis</h1>
            <p>Climate change is the long-term alteration of global or regional temperature and/or weather patterns. This is extremely detrimental to various ecosystems and communities around the world. Human activity is the sole cause of climate change.
                Things like burning fossil fuels, the decomposition of wastes in landfills, deforestation, and mass farming all have a greenhouse effect that is warming the earth. Climate change is destroying the ecosystems of animals that depend on them to survive. 
                This leads to mass extinction and several endangered species across the globe. Climate change drastically changes the weather too. It causes bigger, stronger tropical storms, hotter summers, colder winters and longer droughts affects various living 
                conditions for people around the world.

                <h1>Pollution</h1>
                <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants to the natural environment. 
                Humans produce various types of pollution but they are all detrimental to ecosystems and communities alike. 
                All around the world humans are emitting harmful materials and causing things like global warming.
                Let's look at some different types of pollution, where they come from and how they impact the environment.</p>

                <h1>Ecosystem</h1>
                <p>According to National Geographic the average global temperature has increased by more than 1.6 degrees.
                Leading to glaciers melting at an alarming rate, unprecedented shifts in the water cycle,
                as well as causing many animals to migrate to escape the damage.</p>

                <h1>Ozone Depletion</h1>
                <p>The ozone layer protects the Earth from harmful rays and its depletion makes us vulnerable to those rays.
                even in the absence of ozone depletion, by wearing hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen.
                sHowever, these precautions will become more important as ozone depletion worsens.</p>
